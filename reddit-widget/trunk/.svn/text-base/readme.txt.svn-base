== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Nothing shows up when I try it or I get an error that file_get_contents doesn't exist =

This script relies on the function file\_get\_contents to fetch the RSS feed. If your host doesn't allow the use of it, but allows the use of curl, you can replace
<pre>$stories = file_get_contents($uri);</pre>
with
<pre>$ch = curl_init();
$timeout = 5; // set to zero for no timeout
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $uri);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, $timeout);
$stories = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);</pre>

= What does cache time mean? = 

It's the number of seconds before the content will be requested again. You can set this to be 0 or -1 to not use the caching system. If you edit any of the widgets in the widget admin panel, the cache is cleared.

== Formatting ==

There are 3 parts needed to format the output.

The first part, called items start in the admin panel, is the first part of the widget after the title. For the default formatting, this is just &lt;ul&gt;.

The second part, called items end, is the ending of the widget. By default, this is:
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a href="%profile%" style="float:right;"&gt;%username%&lt;/a&gt;


The third part is what is called for each item. By default, this is:
&lt;li style="list-style-type: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="%link%"&gt;%title%&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%more%"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

The premise of calling each value is this:

1. start
1. item
1. item
1. ...
1. item
1. end

The formatting for items is:

* %title% - Title of the item
* %link% - Link to the item
* %desc% - Description of the item - Just [link] [more] links
* %date% - Date the item was submitted (ISO)
* %more% - More link - The link to the comments
* %number% - The number of the current item

The formatting for start and end is:

* %username% - Your username
* %profile% - Link to your profile
* %rss% - Link to your profileâ€™s RSS feed
* %count% - Number of items shown
